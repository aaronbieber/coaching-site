How well does your resume or LinkedIn profile reflect the value you bring into
your work? Does it stand out from the hundreds of other applicant profiles a
recruiter sees every day? Based on your resume alone, why would someone want to
hire you?

A great resume tells a story about where you've come from, what you can do, and
why hiring you is going to be the best decision any company could make.

I'll help you showcase yourself authentically, drawing on my two decades of
experience in the tech industry, my work in coaching and interviewing engineers,
and my long-practiced writing skills.

Which of these sounds better to you?

* Took on role as tech lead/scrum master, doubled sprint velocity, managed
  project plans/comms.

Or:

* Took responsibility for the end-to-end software development lifecycle,
  resulting in a permanent 200% increase in sprint team velocity. Recognized by
  stakeholders for improved transparency and predictability of project outcomes.

They both present roughly the same facts, but which one would you rather share
with the recruiters and hiring managers you’re talking to?
