## Your technologist coach

After a failed bid to get into the Rhode Island School of Design, which I was
sure would land me a dream job as a graphic designer, I found myself applying my
self-taught programming skills at an educational start-up. I ended up staying
with that company through five tumultuous years.

While hopping between start-ups, I co-founded a photography instruction business
with a close friend and taught on-location workshops across the country. Though
we had to shutter the business in the '08 financial crisis, I learned that
teaching was a source of great fulfillment for me.

One job led to another, and now I've been in the software industry for over 20
years and have worked for both start-ups and giants like Wayfair.

As I worked for increasingly large and complex tech organizations, and took on
more leadership responsibilities, my job slowly shifted from solving software
problems to solving people problems.

Eventually, I came to the realization that a lot of what I had been doing to
help people find their paths forward is actually coaching.

When I'm not coaching people through their unique challenges, you'll find me
hanging out with my son, taking landscape and architectural photographs, or
flying my drone.

What would you create, if you knew you couldn't fail?
