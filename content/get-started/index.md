## How does this work, anyway?

Think of coaching as a partnership. My clients and I work together to take a
pile of questions, aspirations, and values, and convert them into a plan with
discrete and recognizable steps. Then, we get to work on them.

Coaching can be challenging, emotional, and fulfilling. I find that I work best
with folks who have something important to them that they're working on. Maybe
that's a decision about taking on more leadership at work, or maybe it's a
struggle to maintain relationships with difficult colleagues.

Whatever *your* important challenge is, I'm ready to join you on your journey.
I'll bring my expertise in navigating change, creating clarity, and my two
decades of experience in the tech industry.

We might work together for just a couple of months, or for longer than a year.
It all depends on what *you* need to complete *your quest*. We'll work together
to create a partnership that is right for you.
